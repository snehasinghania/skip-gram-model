 Marshall added that the city might have to consider condemning the building if conditions did not improve, which, at press time, the Trump administration had not objected to

Roger Goodell Lays Wreath At National Football League Cemetery In Super Bowl Tradition
Vol 53 Issue 04  Sports  Football  Super Bowl  Nfl Football  Roger Goodell
 ,  As part of a longstanding tradition in the week leading up to the Super Bowl,   commissioner Roger Goodell laid a wreath Friday in an official ceremony at the National Football League Cemetery
The somber 40-minute memorial service, which was held in the hazy morning hours before a gathering that included   officials, members of the press, and several dozen active Pro Bowlers, paid tribute to the thousands of football players laid to rest in the leagues sprawling 500-acre cemetery
As we continue to celebrate this weeks festivities leading up to Super Bowl  , it is important that we take the time to reflect on all of the brave young Americans who have given their lives to this great game, said Goodell in a stoic address, speaking against the backdrop of the hundreds of rows of perfectly aligned silver headstones that crisscross the expansive cemetery
 These men, some of them as young as 21 or 22 years old, sacrificed their bodies, and ultimately their lives, in the name of the National Football League
 When they were draftedno matter where they were sent or which round they were selectedthey stood tall and fearlessly risked life and limb for their franchise
We must never forget that the games we all enjoy as a country every Sunday do not come without a cost, Goodell continued
 And these courageous men paid the ultimate price out there on the football field
Following his remarks, the commissioner offered his individual thanks to several of the young wives and children of recently deceased players in attendance, before bowing his head for a moment of silence
 The ceremony reportedly concluded with a lone bugler playing a slow, somber rendition of the Monday Night Football theme song
According to sources, Goodell then quietly toured the burial grounds with his wife for several hours, occasionally kneeling before a gravestone to read the name and position of a deceased player and quietly say a prayer
 The commissioner was later seen fighting back tears as he walked through the rolling hills of Section 10, the zone reserved for the leagues many fallen quarterbacks
Afterwards, Goodell reportedly made his way to the far western corner of the grounds to view an untouched plot of land that the league recently acquired, which will allow for a much-needed expansion of the increasingly overcrowded cemetery
As we honor those who gave their own lives, we must also remember those who, though still with us today, bear the many scars from their years of service, Goodell told reporters while walking along the path leading to the marble mausoleum reserved for fallen members of the 1972 Miami Dolphins
 Many of these men returned from their stints around the league suffering from debilitating injuries and unimaginable traumasome, tragically, could never walk again
 People often fail to appreciate how difficult it can be for these men to lead normal lives once their days in uniform are over
Of course, it is sometimes the psychological scars, though invisible, that can be the most painful, added Goodell
 However, their incredible bravery and resilience is an inspiration to us all
The day marked Goodells 11th visit to the hallowed grounds, a tradition that former commissioner Pete Rozelle began in 1970 after the  -  merger, when the remains of dozens of former players were exhumed, transported, and consecrated at the newly constructed National Football League Cemetery
 Despite having paid his respects every year since his appointment as commissioner in 2006, Goodell told reporters that the days events were equally as powerful and moving to him as they were during his very first visit the week of Super Bowl  
For those families who these husbands, fathers, and sons have left behind, we know that the void can never truly be filled, said Goodell
 But we also know that their legacies live on with each and every week of the   season
For without their sacrifice, we would not be the $13 billion organization that we are today, Goodell added
New Uber Update Allows Users To File Lawsuit Against Company Directly In App
   In a move designed to streamline the products interface and facilitate one of the more common interactions between customers and the ride-sharing service, Uber announced Wednesday that its newest update would allow users to file a lawsuit against the company from directly within the app
 Describing it as a major time-saver over traditional napkins, Procter & Gamble announced Thursday the release of its new Bounty pre-sauced napkins, which have been expressly designed to be removed from the package and immediately thrown into the trash
 With this new innovation, weve cut out all the extra steps between procuring a napkin and then crumpling it up and discarding it, said the companys director of marketing, Chase Henderson, explaining that the ready-soiled paper goods completely eliminate the need to first spill something and then wipe it up
 For our initial rollout, the napkins will come partially saturated in your choice of chili, ranch dressing, or spaghetti sauce
 Down the road, were hoping to introduce napkins that are already wadded up into a big, messy clump, so customers can simply place the entire 200-count package in the garbage all at once
 Henderson added that the company was also developing a new paper plate that comes pre-stained with a triangle of pizza grease
You Would Do The Same Thing If An Old Witch Had Your Fathers Soul Trapped In A Lantern
 You dont think that I know there are disgusting, reprehensible, dangerous things coming out of my mouth at all times? That my vile, indefensible words seek only to shelter the nations newly installed administration from the slightest shred of accountability? And that Ive done it all with a self-righteous arrogance that suggests outright contempt for the truth and our nations founding principles? Of course I do
 I have behaved in ways that defy not only logic and common sense, but also basic human decency
 And, deservedly, I have been shamed and criticized and insulted for these actions
But answer me truthfully: Who among you wouldnt do the same exact thing if an evil 400-year-old witch had trapped your fathers eternal soul inside a cursed iron lantern, flickering faintly each time his agonized moans escaped the murky, otherworldly ether that is his prison?
Look me in the eye and tell me that you would not heed the crones disgusting instruction to divert attention away from Donald Trumps glaring conflicts of interest, nor undermine the nations entire intelligence apparatus to salve your bosss ego, nor categorically deny objective reality time and time again if so doing released your fathers tortured spirit from the in-between realm and at last let him be at peace
Do you actually think I enjoy appearing on television on behalf of a petty and profoundly unstable narcissist to defend his taped admissions of sexual assault? And as a woman, do you think I like attacking the victims of such horrible abuse as the mouthpiece for that conscienceless degenerate? Do you think its my idea of a good time to slay the fearsome Beast of Obar Chiardair with an opal blade and return to the witch its bloody horns, or to pretend I can stand being anywhere near Eric Trump?
 I must do these foul deeds to free Papa, thinking only of his pained, spectral face slowly disappearing and reappearing behind that accursed, clouded lantern glass while I again take to   and lie about where funding for the border wall is going to come from
When I go home at night, please know that I do three things
 I sit and I weep at the positions I have taken
 I retch in horror at the potential consequences my words will have on civility, reason, and the safety of citizens in our country
 And I stare with sunken eyes at the glow of Papas soul in the lantern, shining brighter only when Ive successfully advocated the unconscionable position that Betsy DeVos is a qualified candidate for Secretary of Education, or growing dimmer when I havent adequately shouted down members of the press by claiming that their fact-checking efforts are a sign of the medias unforgivable bias against this administration
Know that when I work up the courage to look myself in the eye, I see the ghoul I have become
Please understand, it makes me blanch and tremble to even think about what Ive already done, and what I yet still must do
 Had you yourself tried to kill the witch and smash the lantern for the hundredth time and seen your own mother transformed into a millipede for your effortsfinally coming to terms with the fact that the crones magic is simply too strongyou too would find yourself standing up for Trumps attack on a celebrated black U
 Though I warned my father time after time of the dangers of stealing mandrake root from the mystical garden of a powerful hag so that he could once again briefly feel the strength of his youthoh, your vanity, Papa!clearly I could have and should have done more
 But I cant dwell on the past now; I simply dont have time
 Ive completed seven of the 12 tasks and now must shore up Trumps acceptance of anti-vaccination theories and steal a newborn foals first breath before the witch draws the moon down from the sky and sets in motion the Final Degradation
I am so sorrysorry for what Ive done, and even more sorry for what is to come

In the wake of Donald Trump effectively securing the Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday, an "op-ed" written in July by the satirical news site, the Onion, is making the rounds on the Internet today
 Headlined " Admit It: You People Want to See How Far This Goes, Dont You ?" and ostensibly penned by Trump himself, the piece eerily predicts the voyeuristic appeal that has helped propel the real estate magnate to his lofty perch in the race
Its hardly been a month since I entered the field and Ive already alienated Americas largest immigrant population, seen dozens of my high-profile business deals implode one after the other, and publicly insulted a national heros military service, all while not offering a single viable policy idea
 But none of that matters at all, and my candidacy continues to surge forward, because none of you  not a single one of you  can look away
That was written  by acomedy website one month after Trump got into the race
What the Onion piece gets right over and over again is the idea that it didn't and wouldn't matter to voters what Trump said as much as how, where and when he said it
 The public and, yes, the media was desperate for something different, someone who would say and do things no one else would even dream of
"My campaigns just barely begun and Ive already got you begging for more," Trump wrote
 "Sure, you can sayyou oppose me or that you dont even take me seriously
 But let me ask you: How many articles have you read about Ted Cruz lately? How many news segments have you watched on Bobby Jindal? Or Rand Paul? But if those stories have the name 'Donald Trump' in them, well, look who suddenly cant get enough
What Trump understood from the start and what the Onion apparently grasped, too was that this presidential race was all just one big reality show
 That solely by being watchable and interesting and Trump, no matter what else you think, is definitely both of those things he could wildly overachieve in the primary
The resurfacing of the Trump Onion piece will also bring back the argument that the media served as Trump's willing accomplice in all of this
 It's about who we all are and what we say we want versus what we really do want
"Dont delude yourself into thinking its everyone else who wants to watch me do this and youre somehow above it," wrote Trump
 You hear 'Trump' and your attention snaps to the   screen right away
Trump, as imagined by the Onion, is our collective guilty pleasure even if we don't want to admit it
 The message of the piece, which, yes, is meant as satire, is deadly serious: Don't look around to wonder how Trump got this far
 Noting aspects of the job he enjoyed as well as offering what he hoped would be helpful criticism, Barack Obama reportedly filled out a lukewarm review of the presidency on the employer review website Glassdoor a few days after exiting the position last Friday
Fearful Americans Stockpiling Facts Before Federal Government Comes To Take Them Away
 Alarmed at the prospect of unconstitutional overreach by the Trump administration, millions of fearful Americans have already begun stockpiling facts before the federal government comes to take them away, sources confirmed Friday
 I know my rights as an American, so youd better believe Im getting my hands on as many facts as possible and keeping them somewhere safe where this First Amendmenthating president of ours cant snatch them all up, said Pittsburgh resident David Edelman, 38, adding that he was worried that President Trump planned to not only suspend production of facts, but also seize existing ones, leaving Americans and their families completely defenseless
 The minute I saw Trump, I knew he was someone who didnt grow up around facts or the kind of folks who use facts
 Well, the founding fathers cherished my right to possess facts, and theyd be rolling in their graves if they knew the Feds were going to bust in and try to steal our facts in the middle of the night
 A spokesperson for the Trump administration dismissed such fears, saying that the president merely wanted to keep facts away from certain dangerous people

You People Made Me Give Up My Peanut Farm Before I Got To Be President
 presidents have gone to great lengths to avoid potential conflicts of interest
 When I was elected, I followed suit by placing my small business in a blind trust to assure our citizens that I would always put the countrys interests ahead of my own
 Thats why I find it a bit curious that our new commander-in-chief has been allowed to ignore it
For Christs sake, you people made me get rid of my peanut farm before you let me be president
 When my father died, I moved back home and worked those fields with my own two hands to keep it afloat
 It wasnt just a businessit was the place I called home
 Letting go of the family farm was one of the hardest things Ive ever had to do, but I did it because the American people asked me to
 I did it for their sake, without enthusiasm, but also without hesitation
Boy, times sure have changed, havent they? I couldnt help but notice that the current occupant of the White House owns more than 500 companies, has business interests across the Middle East and Asia, and owes hundreds of millions of dollars to banks he is now responsible for regulating
 It seems a touch unfair that a bigger fuss was made about my little peanut operation than all his office towers, hotels, and golf courses combined
 All I had was a farm, you know? A small, precious farm
Seriously, it was just a few fields and a warehouse, and you idiots still appointed a special prosecutor and spent six months investigating it
Not a day goes by when I dont think about what life would be like if I still had my peanut farm
 Id watch the sun come up, watch it cast golden light on my plants, row by row
 It sure wouldve been nice to live out the rest of my years there, but I had to do what was right
And where were my conflicts of interest, exactly? Seriously, do enlighten me, America, because I honestly have no idea
 Did you worry I might be cutting deals in back rooms with the peanut butter lobby? Or that I might be too busy at harvest time to focus on the economy or the Middle East? Apparently, you did, and almost obsessively
 Meanwhile, your new president holds a lease from the federal government to operate a $200 million hotel six blocks from the White House
 Apparently, all I needed to do was hand off control of the farm to my family
 If Id staged an elaborate song and dance about distancing myselfwhatever that meansfrom all the day-to-day planting, picking, and salting, maybe I could have kept my peanut farm with the full blessing of you, the American people
Besides, that peanut farm would probably be worth $200 million today, easy
